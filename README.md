## Platform Setup

### iOS

> Note: Can only be done on a Mac OS X Specific Setup

Additional Requirements

- [bundler](https://bundler.io)

To run Mobidex on the iOS simulator from XCode, follow these steps.

1. From the Mobidex root directory, install all the required javascript packages.

`npm install`

2. Install all the required gems in your project space.

> This command will change to the iOS working directory to setup the required Ruby gems in your local project.

`pushd ios && bundle install --path .gems && bundle exec pod install && popd`

3.  Open `ios/mobidex.xcworkspace` in XCode

4.  Select **Build Phases** for `Pods > secp256k1_swift` target and remove `secp256k1_swift-dummy.m`.

    > Tip: You'll notice there are 2 pods with similar names, we are only working with the one that has the underscore 'secp256k1_swift'

Then, select your device simulator of choice and click the **play** icon at the top left corner of Xcode.

### Android

Start develop in Android:

0.  Make sure your system is setup for react-native.
1.  Install dependencies of project with command `npm install`.
1.  Connect the smartphone or start the your favorite [emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds).
1.  Change `native_modules.gradle` as per this [pull request](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/pull/741/files).
1.  Run the comand `react-native run-android` to compile and run the install project in android.
1.  Run the command `react-native start` to run server js and loading the Mobidex app.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Run the development server which is necessary for debug configurations of the App.

### `npm run patch`

Patches isomorphic-fetch for use with react-native.

### `npm run build:android:release`

This will construct a signed android release. This is the preferred method of constructing an APK at the moment.

NOTE: Make sure `gradle.properties` has `android.enableAapt2=false`. Otherwise, the build will fail with:

```
mobidex/android/app/build/intermediates/res/merged/release/drawable-hdpi/node_modules_reactnavigation_src_views_assets_backicon.png: error: uncompiled PNG file passed as argument. Must be compiled first into .flat file..
error: failed parsing overlays.
```

## Release

### Android

Run `npm run build:android:release`. See notes above.

### iOS

1.  Open mobidex in XCode
2.  Archive App
3.  Upload app to app store

## Notes

### Web3

Web3.js does not load because of its dependence on node.js standard libraries. The majority of them are loaded via the `node-libs-react-native` library. In particular, the `crypto` library requires the `vm` library, which cannot be easily mocked or replaced. To circumvent this, I've forked `node-libs-react-native` and added a browserified crypto library: https://github.com/abec/node-libs-react-native.
